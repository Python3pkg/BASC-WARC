BASC-Warc
=========

`Bibliotheca Anonoma's <http://bibanon.org/>`_ library for creating and managing WARC files.

This library is in the planning / pre-alpha stage. It is still being written, and is not yet suitable for any real-world usage at this point. While we are still writing and designing the API, anything can change without any notice.

Pull requests are appreciated, but due to the early stage of development you may need to overhaul your PR as we update the project code.

This library is primarily written for `BASC-Archiver <https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-Archiver>`_, to be used by a (new?) downloading library.


Planned Features
----------------

* Python 2/3 compatibility.
* Thread-safe.
